The initial findings suggest that the supplemental classroom tool may be an effective way to address unfinished learning from the pandemic, according to researchers.\n\nThe study was conducted in the height of the pandemic during the 2020-21 school year. The sample includes more than 180,000 students in third through eighth grades from 649 schools. <a href=\"http:\/\/khan.co\/MAResearchBrief2022\">Study results<\/a> showed a number of benefits with 30 minutes of use:\n<ul>\n \t<li>On average, test-score gains were 19% larger than projected.<\/li>\n \t<li>Scores increased across all grade levels.<\/li>\n \t<li>Scores increased across gender, race\/ethnicity and poverty level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember the enormous challenges students faced in the 2020-2021 school year,\u201d said Khan Academy founder Sal Khan. \u201cDespite the circumstances, the students in this study who used MAP Accelerator as recommended made gains in math that are larger than projected, even for a pre-pandemic school year.\u201d\n\nThe study analyzed data from MAP Growth, a computer-adaptive assessment developed by NWEA, the not-for-profit research and educational services provider. MAP Growth is administered several times per year and taken by more than a quarter of U.S. students. MAP Growth scores are automatically imported into MAP Accelerator to generate a personalized, mastery-based learning plan for every student.\n\n\u201cWaverly Middle School adopted MAP Accelerator to respond to unfinished learning that had occurred due to the COVID-19-related school disruptions,\u201d said Elizabeth McIntosh, director of curriculum and instruction at Waverly Central School District in Waverly, New York. \u201cThe tool is a great way to support our kids in meeting them where they are instructionally. Our students find it highly engaging while helping them with core instruction, filling gaps, and putting them on a ramp to success.\u201d\n\nThe results of the study suggest a positive and significant relationship between using MAP Accelerator and score gains on the MAP Growth assessment.\n\nA grade-level view shows student gains. The purple, horizontal lines below represent projected gains based on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nwea.org\/normative-data-rit-scores\/\">NWEA norms<\/a>. The green bars depict gains for students who used MAP Accelerator for at least 30 minutes per week.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-42178\" style=\"width: 720px; height: auto;\" src=\"\/content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/map-accelerator-efficacy-press-release_NWEA_thumb-300x162.png\" alt=\"\" \/>\n\nFor example, fifth-grade students who used MAP Accelerator for 30 minutes per week grew an average 18% more than projected, gaining 1.7 points above pre-pandemic norms.\n\n\u201cThe results of this study offer a lot of hope for addressing the impacts of this pandemic, which has disproportionately hit some of our most underserved populations,\u201d said NWEA CEO Chris Minnich. \u201cIt underscores the importance of increased opportunities for students to engage with targeted math content, and a tool like MAP Accelerator makes it possible for teachers to do that efficiently.\u201d\n\nFor an explanation of math RIT scores, please see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nwea.org\/normative-data-rit-scores\/\">Normative Data &amp; RIT Scores<\/a>.\n\nFor more detailed information on the research findings, please see the <a href=\"http:\/\/khan.co\/MATechReport2022\">technical report<\/a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>About MAP Accelerator<\/strong>\n\nA personalized learning tool for grades three through eight, MAP Accelerator reduces the manual work of differentiating math instruction by automatically integrating Clever class rosters, MAP Growth scores and Khan Academy content to generate learning pathways \u2014 complete with lessons, instructional videos and practice problems. Teachers can adjust individual student goals and learning pathways as students master new skills and concepts. District and school administrators can track usage and monitor the effectiveness of MAP Accelerator with easy-to-use reporting dashboards.
