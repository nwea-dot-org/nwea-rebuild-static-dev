					<description><![CDATA[Findings from 2020-2021 school year buck national trend of  sluggish math gains caused by pandemic-related disruptions to learning. Mountain View, Calif., and Portland, Ore., August 16, 2022— A new study]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Findings from 2020-2021 school year buck national trend of  </em><em>sluggish math gains caused by pandemic-related disruptions to learning. </em>

<strong>Mountain View, Calif., and Portland, Ore., August 16, 2022</strong>— A new study released today shows students who use MAP Accelerator, a personalized math tool jointly developed by Khan Academy and NWEA, achieve greater-than-projected gains in math. The initial findings suggest that the supplemental classroom tool may be an effective way to address unfinished learning from the pandemic, according to researchers.

The study was conducted in the height of the pandemic during the 2020-21 school year. The sample includes more than 180,000 students in third through eighth grades from 649 schools. <a href="http://khan.co/MAResearchBrief2022">Study results</a> showed a number of benefits with 30 minutes of use:
<ul>
 	<li>On average, test-score gains were 19% larger than projected.</li>
 	<li>Scores increased across all grade levels.</li>
 	<li>Scores increased across gender, race/ethnicity and poverty level.</li>
</ul>
“I think it’s important to remember the enormous challenges students faced in the 2020-2021 school year,” said Khan Academy founder Sal Khan. “Despite the circumstances, the students in this study who used MAP Accelerator as recommended made gains in math that are larger than projected, even for a pre-pandemic school year.”

The study analyzed data from MAP Growth, a computer-adaptive assessment developed by NWEA, the not-for-profit research and educational services provider. MAP Growth is administered several times per year and taken by more than a quarter of U.S. students. MAP Growth scores are automatically imported into MAP Accelerator to generate a personalized, mastery-based learning plan for every student.

“Waverly Middle School adopted MAP Accelerator to respond to unfinished learning that had occurred due to the COVID-19-related school disruptions,” said Elizabeth McIntosh, director of curriculum and instruction at Waverly Central School District in Waverly, New York. “The tool is a great way to support our kids in meeting them where they are instructionally. Our students find it highly engaging while helping them with core instruction, filling gaps, and putting them on a ramp to success.”

The results of the study suggest a positive and significant relationship between using MAP Accelerator and score gains on the MAP Growth assessment.

A grade-level view shows student gains. The purple, horizontal lines below represent projected gains based on <a href="https://www.nwea.org/normative-data-rit-scores/">NWEA norms</a>. The green bars depict gains for students who used MAP Accelerator for at least 30 minutes per week.

For example, fifth-grade students who used MAP Accelerator for 30 minutes per week grew an average 18% more than projected, gaining 1.7 points above pre-pandemic norms.

“The results of this study offer a lot of hope for addressing the impacts of this pandemic, which has disproportionately hit some of our most underserved populations,” said NWEA CEO Chris Minnich. “It underscores the importance of increased opportunities for students to engage with targeted math content, and a tool like MAP Accelerator makes it possible for teachers to do that efficiently.”

		<title>New NWEA Research on Learning Through the Pandemic Shows Early Signs of Rebounding</title>

					<description><![CDATA[Portland, Ore. — July 19, 2022 — NWEA — a not-for-profit, research and educational services organization serving K-12 students – announced today new research highlighting the latest data on achievement]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Portland, Ore. — July 19, 2022 — </strong><a href="https://www.nwea.org/">NWEA</a> — a not-for-profit, research and educational services organization serving K-12 students – announced today <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/student-achievement-in-2021-22-cause-for-hope-and-continued-urgency">new research</a> highlighting the latest data on achievement during the pandemic. Key findings from this third school year impacted by COVID-19 suggest early signs of rebounding offering some hope. However, results also underscore that recovery is still years away and there is a need for sustained urgency in addressing interrupted learning.

The study is the <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/theme/covid-19-and-schools">latest in a series of research</a> from NWEA focused on tracking the impact of the pandemic on learning. It used data from over 8.3 million students who took the MAP Growth assessment in reading and math during the COVID-impacted years (spanning 2018-19 to 2021-22) and compared these data to an equivalent sized sample of students who tested before the pandemic (spanning 2015-16 to 2018-19). Key takeaways from this latest data bring both hope and concern.

<strong>Early signs of hope: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Initial signs of academic rebounding were evident in 2021-22 with academic gains (fall to spring) that paralleled pre-pandemic trends, especially in math and among younger students.</li>
 	<li>Academic growth rebounded to parallel pre-pandemic trends across school-poverty levels; however, students in low-poverty schools have less ground to make-up and thus will likely recover faster.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Continued concern:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Despite initial signs of rebounding, student achievement is still lower than where we’d expect it to be if the pandemic did not happen. Furthermore, if improvements continue at the rate we saw this year, the timeline for a full recovery is years away and will likely extend past the availability of federal recovery funds.</li>
 	<li>Achievement was lower for all student groups in spring 2022 (compared to pre-pandemic levels); with historically marginalized students and students in high-poverty schools remaining disproportionately impacted.</li>
</ul>
“These signs of rebounding are especially heartening during another challenging school year of more variants, staff shortages, and a host of uncertainties. We think that speaks volumes to the tremendous effort put forth by our schools to support students,” said <strong>Dr. Karyn Lewis</strong>, Director of the Center for School and Student Progress at NWEA, and the co-author with Dr. Megan Kuhfeld on this research study. “Any signs of hope are reasons to celebrate, and we must take that moment to do so, and then push forward with renewed energy and a sense of urgency because we’re just at the initial steps of addressing the tremendous impact of this pandemic on our students.”

NWEA’s researchers point out that this data is a national view of the continued impacts of the pandemic, which provides a broad “where are trends heading” perspective. But they urge that local context is just as, if not more, important. They note that even within districts, impacts are not equal between schools. That level of nuance should be evaluated when looking at recovery efforts and long-term planning so that schools can “right-size” their efforts to most effectively help all students move toward better outcomes.

While schools work tirelessly to support the growth of students, they cannot do this alone. Over the past two years, NWEA has collaborated with colleagues from across the policy and civil rights community to offer<a href="https://www.nwea.org/resource-center/resource/informing-covid-19-recovery-insights-from-nweas-map-growth-assessment-and-policy-recommendations-2/"> recommendations to support pandemic recovery</a>, and we continue that push going into the next school year.

“We urge policymakers and education leaders to use data and have strong data systems that provide continuous feedback on interventions to inform recovery,” said<strong> Lindsay Dworkin</strong>, SVP of Policy and Communications at NWEA. “Beyond investing in research-based interventions that are targeted at students most impacted by the pandemic, education leaders will need the resources, support, and flexibility necessary to expand instructional time for students as well as provide more professional learning opportunities to their teachers.”
