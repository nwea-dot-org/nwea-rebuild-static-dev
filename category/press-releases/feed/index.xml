					<description><![CDATA[Findings from 2020-2021 school year buck national trend of  sluggish math gains caused by pandemic-related disruptions to learning. Mountain View, Calif., and Portland, Ore., August 16, 2022— A new study]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Findings from 2020-2021 school year buck national trend of  </em><em>sluggish math gains caused by pandemic-related disruptions to learning. </em>

<strong>Mountain View, Calif., and Portland, Ore., August 16, 2022</strong>— A new study released today shows students who use MAP Accelerator, a personalized math tool jointly developed by Khan Academy and NWEA, achieve greater-than-projected gains in math. The initial findings suggest that the supplemental classroom tool may be an effective way to address unfinished learning from the pandemic, according to researchers.

The study was conducted in the height of the pandemic during the 2020-21 school year. The sample includes more than 180,000 students in third through eighth grades from 649 schools. <a href="http://khan.co/MAResearchBrief2022">Study results</a> showed a number of benefits with 30 minutes of use:
<ul>
 	<li>On average, test-score gains were 19% larger than projected.</li>
 	<li>Scores increased across all grade levels.</li>
 	<li>Scores increased across gender, race/ethnicity and poverty level.</li>
</ul>
“I think it’s important to remember the enormous challenges students faced in the 2020-2021 school year,” said Khan Academy founder Sal Khan. “Despite the circumstances, the students in this study who used MAP Accelerator as recommended made gains in math that are larger than projected, even for a pre-pandemic school year.”

The study analyzed data from MAP Growth, a computer-adaptive assessment developed by NWEA, the not-for-profit research and educational services provider. MAP Growth is administered several times per year and taken by more than a quarter of U.S. students. MAP Growth scores are automatically imported into MAP Accelerator to generate a personalized, mastery-based learning plan for every student.

“Waverly Middle School adopted MAP Accelerator to respond to unfinished learning that had occurred due to the COVID-19-related school disruptions,” said Elizabeth McIntosh, director of curriculum and instruction at Waverly Central School District in Waverly, New York. “The tool is a great way to support our kids in meeting them where they are instructionally. Our students find it highly engaging while helping them with core instruction, filling gaps, and putting them on a ramp to success.”

The results of the study suggest a positive and significant relationship between using MAP Accelerator and score gains on the MAP Growth assessment.

A grade-level view shows student gains. The purple, horizontal lines below represent projected gains based on <a href="https://www.nwea.org/normative-data-rit-scores/">NWEA norms</a>. The green bars depict gains for students who used MAP Accelerator for at least 30 minutes per week.

For example, fifth-grade students who used MAP Accelerator for 30 minutes per week grew an average 18% more than projected, gaining 1.7 points above pre-pandemic norms.

“The results of this study offer a lot of hope for addressing the impacts of this pandemic, which has disproportionately hit some of our most underserved populations,” said NWEA CEO Chris Minnich. “It underscores the importance of increased opportunities for students to engage with targeted math content, and a tool like MAP Accelerator makes it possible for teachers to do that efficiently.”

					<description><![CDATA[Portland, Ore. — July 19, 2022 — NWEA — a not-for-profit, research and educational services organization serving K-12 students – announced today new research highlighting the latest data on achievement]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Portland, Ore. — July 19, 2022 — </strong><a href="https://www.nwea.org/">NWEA</a> — a not-for-profit, research and educational services organization serving K-12 students – announced today <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/student-achievement-in-2021-22-cause-for-hope-and-continued-urgency">new research</a> highlighting the latest data on achievement during the pandemic. Key findings from this third school year impacted by COVID-19 suggest early signs of rebounding offering some hope. However, results also underscore that recovery is still years away and there is a need for sustained urgency in addressing interrupted learning.

The study is the <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/theme/covid-19-and-schools">latest in a series of research</a> from NWEA focused on tracking the impact of the pandemic on learning. It used data from over 8.3 million students who took the MAP Growth assessment in reading and math during the COVID-impacted years (spanning 2018-19 to 2021-22) and compared these data to an equivalent sized sample of students who tested before the pandemic (spanning 2015-16 to 2018-19). Key takeaways from this latest data bring both hope and concern.

<strong>Early signs of hope: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Initial signs of academic rebounding were evident in 2021-22 with academic gains (fall to spring) that paralleled pre-pandemic trends, especially in math and among younger students.</li>
 	<li>Academic growth rebounded to parallel pre-pandemic trends across school-poverty levels; however, students in low-poverty schools have less ground to make-up and thus will likely recover faster.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Continued concern:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Despite initial signs of rebounding, student achievement is still lower than where we’d expect it to be if the pandemic did not happen. Furthermore, if improvements continue at the rate we saw this year, the timeline for a full recovery is years away and will likely extend past the availability of federal recovery funds.</li>
 	<li>Achievement was lower for all student groups in spring 2022 (compared to pre-pandemic levels); with historically marginalized students and students in high-poverty schools remaining disproportionately impacted.</li>
</ul>
“These signs of rebounding are especially heartening during another challenging school year of more variants, staff shortages, and a host of uncertainties. We think that speaks volumes to the tremendous effort put forth by our schools to support students,” said <strong>Dr. Karyn Lewis</strong>, Director of the Center for School and Student Progress at NWEA, and the co-author with Dr. Megan Kuhfeld on this research study. “Any signs of hope are reasons to celebrate, and we must take that moment to do so, and then push forward with renewed energy and a sense of urgency because we’re just at the initial steps of addressing the tremendous impact of this pandemic on our students.”

NWEA’s researchers point out that this data is a national view of the continued impacts of the pandemic, which provides a broad “where are trends heading” perspective. But they urge that local context is just as, if not more, important. They note that even within districts, impacts are not equal between schools. That level of nuance should be evaluated when looking at recovery efforts and long-term planning so that schools can “right-size” their efforts to most effectively help all students move toward better outcomes.

While schools work tirelessly to support the growth of students, they cannot do this alone. Over the past two years, NWEA has collaborated with colleagues from across the policy and civil rights community to offer<a href="https://www.nwea.org/resource-center/resource/informing-covid-19-recovery-insights-from-nweas-map-growth-assessment-and-policy-recommendations-2/"> recommendations to support pandemic recovery</a>, and we continue that push going into the next school year.

“We urge policymakers and education leaders to use data and have strong data systems that provide continuous feedback on interventions to inform recovery,” said<strong> Lindsay Dworkin</strong>, SVP of Policy and Communications at NWEA. “Beyond investing in research-based interventions that are targeted at students most impacted by the pandemic, education leaders will need the resources, support, and flexibility necessary to expand instructional time for students as well as provide more professional learning opportunities to their teachers.”

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Educators in both states will benefit from research-backed services to help their schools drive achievement</em>

<strong>Portland, Ore., April 28, 2022</strong> — NWEA — the not-for-profit, research and educational services provider serving K-12 students — announced today that the Hawaii State Department of Education (DOE) has added NWEA’s school improvement services to their approved list of vendors. In addition, in Michigan, NWEA has been added to the Michigan Association of Intermediate School Administrators (MAISA) <a href="https://www.gomaisa.org/projects/mistrategybank/">MiStrategy Bank</a> as an evidence-based strategy for use in district MICIP (Michigan Integrated Continuous Improvement Process) plans.

“We’re excited to work with educators in these states and bring our research-based strategies to their schools,” said <strong>Carrie Phillips</strong>, Senior Director of School Improvement Services at NWEA. “Along with supportive expertise, educators will benefit from our exclusive partnership with UChicago Impact and its nationally renowned <a href="https://www.nwea.org/resource-center/fact-sheet/36805/5Essentials-Framework-uChicago_NWEA_factsheet.pdf/">5Essentials® System</a>, which has proven to drive outcomes for students.”

Each state has approved specific services for their school districts:

<strong>Hawaii State DOE</strong> approved the following priority areas of school improvement services:

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Needs Assessment and Planning:</strong> The NWEA Needs Assessment, based around UChicago Impact’s <a href="https://www.nwea.org/resource-center/fact-sheet/36805/5Essentials-Framework-uChicago_NWEA_factsheet.pdf/">5Essentials® System</a>, uses interviews, focus groups, and observations of professional collaboration to capture insights from school leaders and educators to identify strengths and areas of needs for a school’s organizational conditions. An NWEA Leadership Coach then summarizes findings and makes recommendations for continuous improvement.</li>
 	<li><strong>Training in Leadership: </strong>The NWEA Leadership Coach teams up with the school/district leadership team, shares the goals of the NWEA Needs Assessment, links the school improvement processes directly to the district and school’s strategic plan, and then guides leaders along a successful school improvement pathway.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Michigan Association of Intermediate School Administrators</strong> has added <a href="https://www.nwea.org/resource-center/fact-sheet/36808/5Essentials-Framework-UChicago-_NWEA_factsheet.pdf/">The 5Essentials® Survey</a> (via NWEA) to the <a href="https://www.gomaisa.org/projects/mistrategybank/">MiStrategy Bank</a> as an evidence-based strategy for use in district MICIP plans.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Portland, Ore., April 26, 2022 </strong>— <a href="https://www.nwea.org/">NWEA</a> — the not-for-profit, research and educational services provider serving K-12 students — announced today a new professional learning series featuring workshops that activate the power of data to drive instructional decisions and help change teaching practices in order to develop students’ learning, well-being, and self-efficacy.

“We know that simply giving a test is of no use if that data isn’t used to inform adjustments in teaching and learning,” said<strong> Jacob Bruno</strong>, VP of Professional Learning at NWEA. “But far too often, there is a data-instruction disconnect. We are launching this series to help connect those dots for educators, and support them with the skills to make teaching truly responsive, equitable and impactful.”

The professional learning series summarizes the best research and information from respected educational leaders layered with an understanding of the challenges impacting classrooms in the last few years to identify key practices that support a thriving student learning environment in a post-pandemic era. The series supports and encourages educators to celebrate hard work already underway and then take next steps that make needed, appropriate, swift, and positive action a reality. The series includes three categories of offerings:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Assessment empowered classrooms
</strong>Offers educators a framework for appropriately using assessments and their results to inform critical instruction-related decisions.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Responsive learning cycles
</strong>Supports educators in making effective day-to-day and in-the-moment learning “moves” with their students that are swift, appropriate and needed.</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Goal setting to empower (and motivate) students </strong></li>
</ul>
Based on the book, <a href="https://us.corwin.com/en-us/nam/step-into-student-goal-setting/book277600"><em>Step into Student Goal Setting: A Path to Growth, Motivation, and Agency</em></a>, authored by NWEA’s Dr. Chase Nordengren, the sessions highlight how teachers can use goal setting with students as an integral strategy to motivate, increase learning, express confidence, and achieve aspirations. A copy of the book is provided to each attendee.

The sessions in each category are available in formats that best meet the needs of educators: onsite, virtual, small group, or 1:1.

“Our organization’s history is deeply rooted in providing quality data to our educational community. But what we’ve observed over the years is that data is not always being effectively used in ways that improve student outcomes and lead to actions that produce equitable teaching practices,” said <strong>Chris Minnich</strong>, CEO of NWEA. “Data alone is of no value if it doesn’t influence instruction in ways that are truly responsive to the needs of individual students. That’s why we’re investing our efforts beyond just providing quality data toward support that leads to effective instruction.”

The new professional learning series is available now. To learn more about the series, go to: <a href="https://www.nwea.org/responsive-teaching-and-learning/">https://www.nwea.org/responsive-teaching-and-learning/</a>

					<description><![CDATA[NWEA Releases Research Analysis Illuminating Impact of Learning Interruptions on Historically Underserved Students; Underscores Benefits of High-Quality Summer Learning Opportunities Portland, Ore. — April 11, 2022 — As we approach]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>NWEA Releases Research Analysis Illuminating Impact of Learning Interruptions on Historically Underserved Students; Underscores Benefits of High-Quality Summer Learning Opportunities</em>

<strong>Portland, Ore. — April 11, 2022 — </strong>As we approach the end of the third straight year of learning disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. classrooms continue to address the immediate needs of students while prioritizing academic progress for all. For many students—particularly those that are historically underserved—the summer break from learning perpetuates inequitable achievement gaps.

This insight was among those released today by <a href="https://nwea.org/">NWEA </a>in an <a href="https://www.nwea.org/blog/2022/lets-talk-about-summer-some-student-groups-lose-more-ground-when-school-is-out/">overview of current </a><a href="https://www.nwea.org/blog/2022/lets-talk-about-summer-some-student-groups-lose-more-ground-when-school-is-out/">research studies</a> that examined K-8 student progress during a typical school year (non pandemic) and over the summer. The research reveals important information about the degree to which being in school reduces achievement gaps and points to the importance of high-quality summer programming in supporting student success.

“Our research analysis revealed reasons for both optimism and concern. While the findings disrupt some long-held deficit-based thinking about some of these student groups, they also demonstrate the disproportionate impact that learning interruptions have on their achievement in the long-term, making high quality summer learning opportunities and other interventions critical,” said <strong>Lindsay Dworkin</strong>, VP of Policy and Advocacy at NWEA. “Taken collectively, these studies can help education leaders and policymakers identify interventions needed for these student groups to help address the inequitable learning patterns in U.S. public schools.”

The research used MAP Growth assessment data and revealed that while students with disabilities, English learners, and rural students make gains at rates equal to or faster than their grade-level peers during the school year, these students also experience greater learning loss in the summer, leading to persistent achievement gaps.

“We have long known the impact of the summer slide on student learning; however, this data gives us a deeper look into just how critical high-quality summer opportunities are for many of our underserved students,&#8221; said <strong>Deborah Delisle, </strong>CEO of <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fall4ed.org%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Csimona.beattie%40nwea.org%7C6b240bf7f5e944da9ee808da1357f676%7C021f982f7042437ea81c86ed38d5da95%7C1%7C0%7C637843565787803416%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=68kGQBLKEvA8DLDDcKTGIgjsvCCpubtkmnHBmxG8IuA%3D&amp;reserved=0">All4Ed</a>, formerly the Alliance for Excellent Education. &#8220;This information demonstrates that our system is effective at educating our students during the school year, and it is a call to action for states and districts on how to target summer programming so that all students can excel in school and beyond. Our children deserve nothing less.&#8221;

Highlights from the research include:


<ul>
 	<li><strong>Rural Students</strong> — In <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/the-forgotten-20-percent-achievement-and-growth-in-rural-schools-across-the-nation/">a study of K-8 students nationwide</a>, rural students came into kindergarten with higher achievement levels in math and reading than their non-rural peers; but by the end of third grade non-rural students consistently outperformed those from rural communities across the grades. Rural students grow at slightly faster rates in math and reading than other students when school is in session, but lose more ground almost every summer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Students with Disabilities </strong>— In a <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/understanding-differential-growth-during-school-years-and-summers-for-students-in-special-education/">study of K-4 students nationwide</a>, students with disabilities enter kindergarten behind their peers in reading and math, but go on to make gains at similar or higher rates than their peers during some school years. However, students with disabilities lose more ground every summer, which contributes to widening disparities in achievement.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>English Learners (ELs)</strong> — A <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/achievement-and-growth-for-english-learners-2/">third research study</a> looked at achievement and growth for K &#8211; 4 for ELs. It showed that ELs had lower test scores than their non-EL peers through their elementary years, but they also made academic growth similar to or at greater levels as their non-EL peers. However, the student group that was consistently identified as needing EL services tended to lose more ground over the summer than their non-EL peers or their multilingual peers who were ELs at some point but not consistently through K-4.

&#8220;This new study underscores both the urgency and need to invest in interventions that support the academic recovery of English learners. Even before the pandemic, multi-lingual learners lost more ground than their peers during the summer when they were out of school,” said <strong>Eric Rodriguez</strong>, SVP of Policy and Advocacy at <a href="https://www.unidosus.org/">UnidosUS</a>. “After the last two years of interrupted learning for all students, it is more crucial than ever to target significant resources to support retaining and accelerating academic progress and learning for English learners during the summer. Summer support should include bilingual programming that combines academic and enrichment activities staffed with specialists to provide specific language development support and appropriate materials for English learners.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/learning-during-covid-19-an-update-on-student-achievement-and-growth-at-the-start-of-the-2021-22-school-year/">Previous NWEA assessment data</a> show that all students started this school year behind where they would be in a typical year and that historically marginalized groups were most severely impacted. Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN), and Black students had much bigger declines in achievement than Asian American and White students.

NWEA researchers will also continue to conduct research into learning patterns that occur during the school year and over the summer and hope that new data will show a narrowing of gaps and more equitable learning conditions for all students. Additionally, NWEA researchers are <a href="https://www.nwea.org/news-center/press-releases/nwea-center-for-education-policy-research-at-harvard-university-and-calder-at-the-american-institutes-for-research-announce-new-initiative-to-help-examine-district-covid-19-recovery-efforts/">partnering with </a><a href="https://www.nwea.org/news-center/press-releases/nwea-center-for-education-policy-research-at-harvard-university-and-calder-at-the-american-institutes-for-research-announce-new-initiative-to-help-examine-district-covid-19-recovery-efforts/">CALDER </a><a href="https://www.nwea.org/news-center/press-releases/nwea-center-for-education-policy-research-at-harvard-university-and-calder-at-the-american-institutes-for-research-announce-new-initiative-to-help-examine-district-covid-19-recovery-efforts/">at American Institutes of Research (AIR) and the Center of Education Policy and Research at Harvard</a> to support a group of districts in determining how interventions are supporting COVID recovery.

“With the school year soon coming to an end, we can all look to summer as the perfect time to provide additional quality learning opportunities for students impacted by the pandemic. To ensure these opportunities are engaging and successful, states need actionable research on effective strategies that leverage afterschool, summer learning, and community partners,” said <strong>Paolo DeMaria</strong>, <a href="https://www.nasbe.org/">NASBE</a> President and CEO. “This summer learning research brief can inform state boards about what works to support students in high-quality summer programs that sustain positive gains made during the school year. High quality summer programs coupled with relevant ongoing evaluation will help unlock the tools we need to reduce summer learning loss and continue to accelerate student learning so each and every student thrives.”

<strong>NWEA’s Let’s Talk about Summer Twitter Chat</strong>

NWEA’s Policy and Advocacy Team will host a Twitter chat on April 12th at 2pm EDT to discuss barriers these student groups face, how high-quality summer programs could close these gaps, as well as how districts can use federal recovery funds to support students who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Join @NWEApolicy on Twitter using the hashtag #SummerLearningChat.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>100 AK educators will have the opportunity to strengthen their science of reading instructional practices  </em>


<strong>Portland, Ore., Oakland, Calif., Juneau, Alaska – February 3, 2022</strong> – <a href="https://www.nwea.org/">NWEA</a>, <a href="https://www.corelearn.com/">CORE®</a> and <a href="https://asdn.org/">Alaska Staff Development Network (ASDN)</a>,  in partnership with the <a href="https://education.alaska.gov/">Alaska Department of Education and Early Development (DEED)</a>, announced today a new learning, collaboration, and coaching program that will empower 100 literacy specialists, instructional coaches, and teachers to enhance their instructional practices, ultimately driving better outcomes for Alaska’s elementary students. The program will utilize federal funds under the Every Student Succeeds Act, Title II and feature CORE’s Online Elementary Reading Academy (OERA), as well as individualized coaching sessions for each participating teacher.

“Better outcomes for Alaska students start with access to teachers utilizing research-grounded, evidence-based instructional practices in the science of reading,” said Jason Mendenhall, President of State Solutions Division at NWEA. “We’re excited to partner with DEED, CORE and ASDN to offer this program to Alaska’s teachers and support their efforts to continuously hone their professional skills in service to their state’s children.”

CORE’s OERA course is a 10-week intensive professional learning experience rooted in the science of reading and focused on accelerating reading achievement. Participants access learning via textbooks, video clips, interactive learning tasks, and webinars and have opportunities to practice skills via weekly online discussion forums, webinars, collaboration activities, self-check exercises, and homework assignments. Instructors will provide support to participants through feedback and dialogue.

“CORE is thrilled to partner with NWEA and Alaska educators to provide our Online Elementary Reading Academy,” said Dale Webster, Vice President of Language &amp; Literacy, at CORE. “We have a long history of partnerships with Alaska school districts and are happy to continue those partnerships to provide high-quality professional learning to improve teaching and learning.”

Beyond the course, NWEA will provide coaching and consultation opportunities for teachers who want to go deeper into the material and individually discuss how to effectively implement the learning into their practice. The not-for-profit organization will also host live events connecting participants with literacy experts to cultivate discussion and community.

Under the coordination of ASDN, which is the professional development arm of the Alaska Council of School Administrators (ACSA), teachers who complete the program will receive a stipend as well as be eligible for continuing education credits through the University of Alaska.

“ASDN looks forward to collaborating with these excellent education organizations to bring innovative professional development and support to Alaskan educators while improving reading and student achievement in our state,” said Lisa Parady, the Executive Director of the Alaska Council of School Administrators (ACSA).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>“Step Into Student Goal Setting” by NWEA’s Chase Nordengren, PhD, equips teachers with the tools they need to help students take ownership of their learning journeys</em>

<strong>Portland, Ore., January 11, 2022 </strong>— <a href="https://www.nwea.org/">NWEA</a> — a not-for-profit, research and educational services provider serving K-12 students — announced today the availability of a new book authored by Chase Nordengren, PhD, senior research scientist at NWEA, focused on student goal setting titled, <a href="https://us.corwin.com/en-us/nam/step-into-student-goal-setting/book277600">“</a><a href="https://us.corwin.com/en-us/nam/step-into-student-goal-setting/book277600"><em>Step Into Student Goal Setting: A Path to Growth, Motivation, and Agency</em></a><a href="https://us.corwin.com/en-us/nam/step-into-student-goal-setting/book277600">.</a><a href="https://us.corwin.com/en-us/nam/step-into-student-goal-setting/book277600"><em>”</em></a> The book is published jointly by Corwin and NWEA and is widely applicable, especially now given the <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/learning-during-covid-19-an-update-on-student-achievement-and-growth-at-the-start-of-the-2021-22-school-year/">pandemic’s disruptions on learning</a>, for teachers, principals, and other educators who are looking for resources and strategies for integrating formative assessment, student metacognition, and motivational strategies to make goal setting an integral instructional strategy.

The research-driven guide provides a framework linking practices of effective educators in ways that help better engage students with high-quality instruction. It weaves research and case studies with practical strategies to demonstrate how goal setting, with clear learning intentions and plenty of scaffolded support by teachers, can lead to high learning growth and student agency; and includes guidance on how to coach students through setting their own goals – recalibrating and celebrating along the way.

“Now more than ever, students need to be engaged with their goals for their learning. This book demonstrates how goal setting can be a critical way to realize student potential,” said Chris Minnich, CEO of NWEA. “Nordengren offers research-backed evidence along with valuable advice for all educators about the power of goal setting to advance learning, motivate students, and establish long term knowledge that will help students succeed.”

“Goal setting is about taking concrete instructional moves that can motivate students. Goals offer students the opportunity to take ownership over their learning, relate what they’re studying to their long-term ambitions, and experience success regardless of how below or above grade level their current knowledge sits,” said Nordengren. “The book’s release is particularly timely as students and educators deal with challenges like the pandemic, the increasing rate at which students transition between different schools and different school districts, and the difficult emotional pressures of growing up in the 21st century.”

Chase Nordengren, PhD is a Sr. Research Scientist at NWEA, where he supports the Professional Learning team. His research includes the development and execution of needs assessment and program evaluation services for partners; supporting school improvement processes; and thought leadership on formative assessment and student goal setting practices. With insatiable curiosity, Chase works closely with leading scholars from around the globe turning theory into actionable practices to drive instructional improvement. He received a PhD in Leadership, Policy, and Organizations in K-12 Systems from the University of Washington as a US Department of Education Institute of Educational Sciences (IES) pre-doctoral fellow.

<em>“Step Into Student Goal Setting”</em> by Chase Nordengren is available to order through <a href="https://us.corwin.com/en-us/nam/step-into-student-goal-setting/book277600">Corwin Publishing Company</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Step-Into-Student-Goal-Setting/dp/1071855204/ref=sr_1_1">Amazon</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[Findings confirm disproportionate impacts and the need to target interventions accordingly Portland, Ore., December 14, 2021 — NWEA — a not-for-profit, research and educational services provider serving K-12 students —]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Findings confirm disproportionate impacts and the need to target interventions accordingly</em>

<strong>Portland, Ore., December 14, 2021 </strong>— <a href="https://www.nwea.org/">NWEA</a> — a not-for-profit, research and educational services provider serving K-12 students — today released <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/learning-during-covid-19-reading-and-math-achievement-in-the-2020-2021-school-year/">new research</a> that illustrates the scale and disproportionate nature of the disruption in student learning resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The research, <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/learning-during-covid-19-an-update-on-student-achievement-and-growth-at-the-start-of-the-2021-22-school-year/"><em>Learning during COVID-19: An update on student achievement and growth at the start of the 2021-22 school year</em></a>, is the third in a series of research briefs by NWEA focused on understanding how the pandemic has affected student reading and mathematics outcomes.

The research examined <a href="https://www.nwea.org/map-growth/">MAP Growth</a> assessment scores from six million U.S. public school students in grades 3-8 from fall 2021 compared to students in the same grade in fall of 2019, the last quarter unaffected by COVID-19. The research found evidence of significant levels of unfinished learning, particularly in math, however, gaps between current achievement and pre-pandemic achievement have not increased since the end of 2020-21, which may indicate the impacts of the pandemic are stabilizing.

Key findings include:
<ul>
 	<li>Student achievement at the start of the 2021-22 school year was lower compared to a typical year, with larger relative declines in math (9 to 11 percentile points) than reading (3 to 7 percentile points).</li>
 	<li>Achievement was lower for all student groups in fall 2021; however, <a href="https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/learning-during-covid-19-reading-and-math-achievement-in-the-2020-2021-school-year/">as our data have illuminated before</a>, historically marginalized students and students in high-poverty schools were disproportionately impacted, particularly in the elementary grades studied.</li>
 	<li>Student gains across the pandemic (from fall 2019 to fall 2021) lagged norms for pre-pandemic growth, especially in math.</li>
 	<li>Normative growth trends across the pandemic varied by pre-pandemic achievement status; higher achievers made gains that were more consistent with projected normative growth, whereas lower-achieving students were more likely to fall short of growth projections.</li>
</ul>
The research findings offer further evidence highlighting the inequitable nature of unfinished learning across the pandemic and shine light on the groups and subject areas that should be targeted for additional support as COVID recovery efforts continue in the 2021-22 school year and beyond.

NWEA undertook this research in an effort to examine students’ academic progress at the start of the third school year impacted by the COVID pandemic so that educators and policymakers are equipped with the current evidence necessary to guide decisions and make adjustments where needed as part of COVID-19 recovery efforts.

“This latest research highlights that while students are back in classrooms it does not mean that all is back to pre-pandemic “normal” even though there are early signs of some stabilization. The ongoing impact continues to disrupt learning and, especially, hit our most vulnerable students,” said <strong>Chris Minnich, </strong>CEO of NWEA. “It is critical &#8212; now more than ever &#8212; that we direct funding where it is needed most and determine the necessary interventions to improve student outcomes, particularly for those who have suffered the greatest disruptions.”

The ongoing impact of the pandemic illuminates the urgency for education leaders to leverage data to understand the varied needs of their students and develop plans to spend their significant federal resources aligned with student need to local contexts. In addition, states and districts should be setting up data collection and reporting processes to understand which interventions are succeeding in improving student outcomes.

&nbsp;

As previously announced, NWEA’s research team is part of the “<a href="https://caldercenter.org/covid-recovery">Road to Recovery</a>” effort in collaboration with <a href="https://caldercenter.org/">CALDER</a><a href="https://caldercenter.org/"> at the American Institutes for Research (AIR)</a> and the <a href="https://cepr.harvard.edu/">Center for Education Policy Research (CEPR) at Harvard University</a>, to help districts examine student achievement and learning gains in connection with COVID-19 recovery programs.
