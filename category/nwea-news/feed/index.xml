<strong>Portland, Ore., June 28, 2022</strong> — <a href="https://www.nwea.org/">NWEA</a> — the not-for-profit, research and educational services provider serving K-12 students — announced today that Dr. Fred McDaniel will serve as the organization’s new President of District Division.  As the president, Fred will provide leadership to drive the growth of the organization and its focus on service and support to more than 4,500 school districts in the US and in 146 countries.

“I am humbled and honored by this opportunity to continue to serve students, teachers, principals and administrators in this broader capacity. My colleagues at NWEA are passionate about our mission and work, and I look forward to collaborating with them on behalf of kids,” said Dr. Fred McDaniel.

Fred has been with NWEA for more than seven years serving in key leadership roles, including his most recent role of EVP of Assessment and Professional Learning leading the Content Advocacy, Psychometrics, School Improvement and Professional Learning teams. Previously he led the Product Management team at NWEA and served as VP of Operations.  Prior to NWEA, he served as the Chief Planning Officer for a large public school system in South Carolina and has also managed assessment and accountability systems in the public sector. Fred holds a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology and Research as well as a Master of Education in Educational Research and Measurement from the University of South Carolina.

“Beyond Fred’s vast expertise and experience in managing diverse teams, leading change and supporting our organization’s vision and growth, he also brings a critical educator voice and deep understanding of school districts and education communities,” said Chris Minnich, CEO of NWEA. “I’m confident he will provide growth opportunities for the District Division, while his leadership skills will ensure we have high functioning teams focused on our mission of partnering to help all kids learn.”

<strong>NWEA Supports the Infrastructure and Jobs Act’s Focus on Closing the Nation’s Digital Divide</strong>

Millions of students lack the powerful home broadband connections and devices required for digital instruction, online collaboration with peers and teachers, and homework. This “Homework Gap” is particularly pronounced for Black, Latino, low income, and rural families. Given the breadth of this systemic challenge for learning, NWEA is thrilled that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act<strong> </strong>prioritizes closing the nation’s digital divide by providing $65 billion for broadband infrastructure and affordability.

NWEA’s CEO, Chris Minnich, said, “The bipartisan infrastructure bill’s broadband investments will be a ‘game changer’ for digital learning, especially for students living in the nation’s most under-connected communities. Building on the FCC’s groundbreaking broadband mapping initiative, these essential new funds will make a huge difference for learners across the country”.

“Today, every student needs access to affordable <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcosn.users.membersuite.com%2Fshop%2Fstore%2F59ce3069-00ce-cd0f-d948-0416a7505d0e%2Fdetail&amp;data=04%7C01%7Csimona.beattie%40nwea.org%7Cf565b833f42c488d05c808d9aaa139fd%7C021f982f7042437ea81c86ed38d5da95%7C1%7C0%7C637728433508002381%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=d8XlOEXtDLlt63z2Rgtb6xbzAZf5W0UTUwb0RwCCtpo%3D&amp;reserved=0">high speed internet</a> connections and <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcosn.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FCoSN%2520ECF%2520Comments%2520for%2520Filing.doc%25204.5.21.pdf&amp;data=04%7C01%7Csimona.beattie%40nwea.org%7Cf565b833f42c488d05c808d9aaa139fd%7C021f982f7042437ea81c86ed38d5da95%7C1%7C0%7C637728433508012336%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=PLIdSBuz8vMz9hlMvDsXfhu3iPvH1jVfAuQNi959Njk%3D&amp;reserved=0">sufficiently powerful devices</a> for digital learning where they live and learn.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Portland, Ore. – August 6, 2021</strong> – <a href="https://nwea.org/">NWEA</a> – the not-for-profit research and education services provider – announced today that its <a href="https://www.nwea.org/map-reading-fluency/">MAP® Reading Fluency<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> assessment which includes a new dyslexia screener is now an approved option for Indiana schools to use for understanding students’ literacy strengths and areas of concern. Screening for dyslexia is a key priority for Indiana as established under the state’s Senate Enrolled Act No. 21, which requires all Indiana schools to screen students in kindergarten through second grade for dyslexia.

According to the <a href="https://dyslexiaida.org/dyslexia-basics-2/">International Dyslexia Association</a> (IDA), perhaps as much as 15 to 20 percent of the population exhibits characteristics of dyslexia, including slow or inaccurate word recognition, poor spelling, and difficulties with decoding. Early identification, even as early as kindergarten, with targeted intervention in reading is tremendously effective in driving long-term literacy outcomes for students. With NWEA’s MAP Reading Fluency, a teacher can screen an entire class within 20 minutes in multiple areas, including phonological and phonemic awareness, sound and symbol recognition, alphabet knowledge, decoding, rapid naming, and encoding while also getting insight into which students may be exhibiting early signs of reading difficulties so further evaluation can be done and interventions applied.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Participation is free, will last a year and the research will be used to improve math learning and education.</em>

The study called, ASSISTments Impact, is seeking 7<sup>th</sup> grade math teachers to volunteer in an opportunity to participate in a powerful professional learning community with educators from around the country, use a tool proven to improve math achievement and earn a stipend for participation in study activities. Participation will not disrupt the classroom or take away from instructional time because ASSISTments is designed to work with teachers’ core curriculum and make the experience better with data. Teachers must be using EngageNY/Eureka, Open Up Resources, or Illustrative Math to apply.

The study is funded by the US Department of Education and conducted by West Ed, in partnership with NWEA. Applications are currently being accepted through the end of this spring. The work will begin this August and run through Spring 2022. Participants will have the option to continue in the professional learning community for one additional year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Andrew McEachin will lead the NWEA’s Collaborative for Student Growth</em></p>
<em> </em>

<strong>Portland, Ore. – April 1, 2021</strong> – Dr. Andrew McEachin joins NWEA today as the new Director of the Collaborative for Student Growth – one of the main research centers for the not-for-profit organization. He brings with him an extensive background in educational research that has helped policy makers and educators make informed decisions about the design and implementation of educational policies and programs.

“We are thrilled that Dr. McEachin is joining NWEA. He is an incredible scholar who will extend the reach of our research that improves the measurement of student learning, informs teaching and learning practices, and advocates for policies that benefit students and teachers,” said Dr. Beth Tarasawa, EVP of Research for NWEA.

Prior to joining NWEA, McEachin was a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, as well as a professor of Policy Analysis at the Pardee RAND Graduate School, co-editor of <em>Educational Researcher</em> and a member of the Board of Directors for the Association for Education Finance and Policy. His research has focused on better understanding determinants of persistent educational inequities and inequalities, as well as evaluating policies and programs aimed at mitigating these inequities and inequalities. Current examples of these include school choice initiatives, student discipline policies, and curricular intensification.

Beyond RAND, his past experiences include assistant professor of Educational Policy Analysis and Program Evaluation in the Department of Leadership, Policy, and Adult and Higher Education at North Carolina State University, and an IES Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Virginia&#8217;s Curry School of Education.  McEachin holds a Ph.D. in Education Policy and an M.A. in Economics from the University of Southern California and an A.B. in History from Cornell University.

As the new Director of the Collaborative for Student Growth, McEachin will lead a diverse team of researchers whose work spans a range of educational measurement and policy issues including achievement gaps, assessment engagement, social-emotional learning, and innovations in how we measure student learning. The Collaborative is also one of the leading centers examining the impact of COVID-19 school disruptions on student learning, and McEachin’s leadership will provide guidance in this endeavor.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>New members will support the organization’s efforts to advocate for research-based policies that drive outcomes for students</em>


<strong>Portland, Ore. – March 11, 2021</strong> – NWEA, a not-for-profit research and assessment provider, announced today the addition of Lindsay Dworkin and LaTanya Pattillo as the newest members to its Policy and Advocacy team. They bring decades of experience and background in policy work to NWEA, enhancing the organization’s advocacy platform and furthering its mission to help all kids learn.

<strong>Lindsay Dworkin will serve as the new VP of Policy and Advocacy. </strong>She was most recently the Director of Policy &amp; State Government Relations at the Alliance for Excellent Education and has previously served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Outreach at the U.S. Department of Education and as an Education Policy Advisor for the former Governor of Delaware, Jack Markell.  As part of her VP role, Lindsay will collaborate with leaders across the organization to outline NWEA’s policy agenda to advance equity, drive innovation in impactful assessment, support better accountability models, and ultimately improve learning outcomes across the country.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Dr. Aaliyah Samuel named Deputy Assistant Secretary for State and Local Engagement</em>

<strong>Portland, Ore. – Feb. 25, 2021</strong> – In an announcement from the U.S. Department of Education today, Dr. Aaliyah Samuel, Executive Vice President of Government Affairs and Partnerships at NWEA – a not-for-profit research and assessment solutions provider, has been appointed by the Biden/Harris Administration as the U.S. Department of Education’s new Deputy Assistant Secretary for State and Local Engagement. She has formally stepped down from her position at NWEA to begin this new role, which will focus on developing an overall strategy and direction for public engagement at the national, state, and local levels.

“NWEA created a space where I could be my true self and lead through a lens of sincerely wanting to be “the best partner,” said Samuel in a farewell message to NWEA staff. “A huge thank you to my team, who I am sure are exhausted of hearing me say, teamwork makes the dream work.”

In her two-year tenure at NWEA, Samuel led efforts in policy and advocacy, including helping the organization set its first policy agenda. She engaged with over 600 state and national influencers and policy makers, published more than 20 blogs and articles with key influencers, such as NASBE, CCSSO and ECS, and presented at more than 20 in-person and virtual events. But one of her highlight initiatives was the completion of a featured podcast called “<a href="https://www.nwea.org/resource-center/type/podcast/">Testing America’s Freedom</a>” in which she discussed with educational leaders the history of laws, policies, and practices that have resulted in systemic inequity within America&#8217;s education system and urgent solutions to help all students succeed.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[On February 22, 2021, the US Department of Education (ED) announced its guidance for states regarding statewide assessment and accountability this spring. We support ED’s provision of flexibilities for accountability as well as its recognition of the value of high-quality assessment data and opportunity-to-learn indicators in evaluating student learning. This information is critical to understanding where students are and who is most in need of support in a year that has illuminated longstanding educational inequities.

We recognize the value of having the most complete picture possible to help facilitate informed planning and equitable allocation of funding and resources. As a provider of assessment for nearly 12 million students across the US, we are ready to support states and districts in leveraging local data from interim assessments to complement statewide summative data and other information they are evaluating to understand the impact of the pandemic on student learning.

It is important to note that locally administered interim assessments, such as MAP<sup>®</sup> Growth<sup><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></sup>, our flagship assessment, are not designed for summative or state accountability purposes and are best used in connection with teaching and learning decisions, whether at the classroom or systems level. States can use MAP Growth data to inform decisions focused on supporting students and schools, taking into consideration differences in student participation and performance compared to prior assessment administrations. For example, the number of students tested across the state in a given grade, subject, and term can be compared to prior terms to better understand participation rates that may reveal access issues or attendance declines. Such data can provide context and caution around longitudinal comparisons of the assessment data and provide further insight on the potential impact of the last year.

This kind of information, when considered alongside non-academic data, can help states develop a more nuanced understanding of student learning needs and aid in the development of differentiated interventions and resources in recognition of the variable impacts of the pandemic across communities. Consideration of other data is key, because a school’s assessment data on their own do not tell a story; rather, a number of factors can contribute to understanding more holistically and completely how a group of students are performing and how best to support their learning needs.

ED recognized this in its guidance to states, suggesting that “transparency on opportunity to learn measures, such as chronic absenteeism and access to key resources like technology, can help inform decisions about student supports for the 2021-2022 school year and beyond.” Factors such as mode and length of instruction also play a role, as do social-emotional learning and community indicators, including increases in families experiencing homelessness, joblessness, and/or food insecurities. When carefully interpreted in context of other information, assessment data is a useful tool in planning and resourcing efforts at the local, state, and federal levels.

We are committed to supporting state and district leaders in understanding where students are in their learning and making informed decisions so that resources can be targeted in a timely fashion to address the most pressing needs for schools and communities. Our partners can expect to receive additional information from us in the coming weeks.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>NWEA community raised $7,703 supporting educators who serve students of color</em>

<strong>Portland, Ore. – Jan. 27, 2021</strong> – NWEA – a not-for-profit research and assessment provider – banded together to help raise funds for incredible teachers who serve students of color. Raising $7,703 in one week, the effort was part of the organization’s MLK Days of Service, which looked a little different this year due to the pandemic (all digital).

“Each MLK Day, our organization focuses on acts of service. This year, we had to think a little differently given the pandemic, but we still wanted to make an impact where (to us) it matters most: in the classroom,” said Vanessa Peterson, VP of DEIA at NWEA. “We also wanted to focus our efforts on some of our most vulnerable populations and that’s why partnering with AdoptAClassroom.org to identify teachers serving students of color just made so much sense.”

Through AdoptAClassroom.org – a 501c3 nonprofit organization and online platform where teachers can submit their requests and needs for classroom support – NWEA staff selected 10 requests by teachers, many who had applied for the Racial Equity in Schools Fund. The initial goal was to raise at least $250 per teacher. By the end of day one, the goal was met so the organization moved up the mark and ended up raising three times the initial goal.

“Many of the teachers that NWEA selected had applied for a grant from our Racial Equity in Schools Fund. Unfortunately, while we did fund 560+ classrooms this winter, we did not have the money to fund all of the wonderful teachers who applied,” said Melissa Hruza, Director of Marketing and Corporate Sponsorship. “NWEA’s support was great timing to help these teachers during such a challenging year!”

With the goal more than exceeded, NWEA and AdoptAClassroom.org had enough funds to support an additional 10 teachers bringing the total to 20 classrooms receiving funding.
